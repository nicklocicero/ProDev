  <string name="prodev_learn">Pro-dev feedback. I was working with the team and it was great to play the forbidden island game with the mindset how do I impact the team. I have learned so far it’s best to pretend I’m playing basketball with my team. Since this is an intellectual venture, highly creative, it’s easy to want to manage things. But in basketball I work to help set things up for others to score points, and try to keep a general team camaraderie for fun and recreation. Anyway, I am learning that sometimes it’s best for me to take something and get it done and the check back in with the team to see how I can help. That way things grow organically rather than me trying to help with everything. Am I supposed to add that to the prodev android app? The doing things and taking initiative is like driving for a layup, myself. But I also don’t run over to a teammate hen he’s shooting and help him shoot his or her basket. All I should do is encourage him to take the shot, which makes it much easier for him to feel confident and do something wholeheartedly without having to worry about someone else hoping he gets it right or now. Less pressure and more results\n\n
  Sometimes I get very down on myself.  At the demo day birthday event I got very upset because a guy was kind of being weird and asking me trick questions about Java.  I didn't want to let it get in my head and realized that's all I have to worry about in the sense that as I progress as a developer, it's more important to stay positive than gripe about whatever flaws other people have, or how I may not be good enough because he didn't talk to me for very long.  Humility and letting my classmates have the opportunities first, along with underpromising, is my code.</string>
