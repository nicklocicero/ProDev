    Why? Make money and do something good!\n
    How? Make cool, interesting, and better products than what\'s available.\n
    What? Leveraging general coding and hacking skills so that I can be a ninja in any type of development. From Cassandra to Angular, Enterprise Java to Python and Flask!</string>

    3 Quantitative Accomplishments of mine:\n
    \t\tI am at level Captain on CodeFights and have won over 70 tournaments\n
    \t\tI amm trained by the SPCA to help abused animals learn to trust people again\n
    \t\tI have reviewed over 800 Udacity Student Projects for Full-stack Web Dev and Android Nanodegrees\n\n

    3 Qualities I Possess:\n
    \t\tExpressive, enjoy the process of expressing ideas and ideas in general (may philosophize too much =P)\n
    \t\tCurious, makes it easy to learn things (can fall down Wikipedia rabbit holes)\n
    \t\tThorough, love spending time in the state of flow, creating (not too attentive to deadlines)\n\n

    I am definitely more Right Brained, however I am much more cerebral than limbic.  I enjoy the state of flow.  That creativity and being in the moment is awesome!
